All processing successfully completed.

Create the Hyperion build directory, if it does not exist, and then
change directory to the Hyperion build directory and run configure
in order to create a custom Makefile in the build directory structure
that is suitable for your platform and environment.

You can use the script "./DoConfigure" to do that using the defaults.
Then change directory to the build directory and issue make, make check,
and perhaps make install.
